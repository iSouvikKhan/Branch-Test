To come out of the VIM editor --> escape + : + wq + enter

To create new branch --> git branch branch_name ( it doesn't shift the control to thr newly created branch )
                     --> it doesn't push the newly created branch to remote repository.
                     --> You have to do it by "git push origin newly_created_branch_name"

To shift to another branch --> git checkout branch_name

To create multiple branches in 1 go --> git branch branch_name1 branch_name2 branch_name3 ( this would create 3 branches. no commas are allowed between names )

To create branch and shift to that branch --> git checkout -b branch_name
                                          --> it doesn't push the newly created branch to remote repository.
                                          --> You have to do it by "git push origin newly_created_branch_name"

To see all available branches --> git branch or git branch --list

After shifting to anothe branch all commands remain same except the push command.
When you say in a branch named br1 and you want to push changes in br1 branch only, in this case push command will be --> git push origin br1

To merge a branch with another branch,-
    Let's say u have 2 branches br1 and br2.
    You are presently in br3 branch (say)
    You want to merge br1 content to br2.
Do,-
    shift to br2
    git merge br1

Wait wait, this much is not enough. After every merge "push" is necessary
Without this you can't see the changes in branch br2

To complete merge process final command --> git push origin br2

To delete branch --> git branch -d branch_name ( it deletes branch from local repository only )

NOTE : If you create a branch and don't "push", it remains in the local repository ( your pc ) only
        The moment u push with or without content, it becomes visible in remote repository ( GitHub )
        After creating the branch if you only push "git push origin new_branch", it copies all the content from the master branch
